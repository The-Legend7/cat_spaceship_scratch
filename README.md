My scratch project is very simple, you can maneuver your character (the cat) using the arrow keys. When you move your pet dog will follow, every time you make contact you will "pet" the dog and the petting counter will increase by 1, your dog will also bark "woof". When you are ready to launch the space shuttle you can approach it and follow the command prompt to press "Spacebar" and watch it blast away.
